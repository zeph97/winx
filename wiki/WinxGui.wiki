= Introduction =

WinxGui is composed of some sub-libraries. They are _winsdk_, _wtl_, _stdext_, _winx_.

_winsdk_, _wtl_ are 3rdparty libraries. _winsdk_ is Windows Platform SDK, which is provided by Microsoft. _wtl_ is Windows Template Library. It is a C++ library for developing Windows applications and UI components. It extends ATL (Active Template Library) and provides a set of classes for controls, dialogs, frame windows, GDI objects, and more. 

_stdext_ is a GUI-less library. _stdext_ means STL (Standard Template Library) extensions. It extends STL and provides a set of classes for diagnosis, memory management, unit tests, file io, etc. _stdext_ is self systematic. It depends nothing else, and you can use it freely. For more information, see [StdExt StdExt Developer Manual].

_winx_ is the core of WinxGui library, of course. It depends _winsdk_(optional), _wtl_, and _stdext_. You may ask me why you based on _wtl_? In _[WinxGuiImpl How does WinxGui works]_ I will answer the question.

WinxGui source code tree looks like this:

I have introduced _stdext_, _winx_, _winsdk_, _wtl_ with you. And _winxsamp_ is examples of WinxGui applications. It is composed of _tutorials_ and _samples_. _tutorials_ are very simple. Mostly a tutorial application only shows ONE feature of WinxGui library. See [Tutorials WinxGui Tutorials]. _samples_ are somewhat complex and useful. See [Samples WinxGui Samples].
